# C400-402: Unnecessary generator - as a <list/set/dict> comprehension.
# It’s unnecessary to use list, set, or dict around a generator expression, since there are equivalent comprehensions for these types. For example:

list(f(x) for x in foo)
set(f(x) for x in foo)
dict((x, f(x)) for x in foo)

list(
    f(x) for x in foo  # should preserve this trailing comment
)
